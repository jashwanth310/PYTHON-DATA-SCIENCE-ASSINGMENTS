'''  3.nested loops:
occurence of one loop statment with in another loop statement
  SYNTAX:
        for i in object:
           body in outer loopw
           for  i in object:
           body of inner loop
when to apply nested loops : when the data or info is hold in the form of 2d data means matrix data
--to track outer loop to maintain rows
-- to track columns, to maintain  inner loop'''


# .write a python program to display avalable colours and sizes of the products in a ecommers application
#using nested loops concepts
#requirments is :
#create list of colours such as red blue green
#create a list to hold sizes like small medium large
#use nested loops to generate all the possible combinations of colurs
#associated with sizes for user to select appropriate product
'''colours=["red", "green", "blue"]
sizes=["small", "medium", "large"]
for row in colours:
    for col in sizes:
        print(f"colour: {row},sizes : {col}")
